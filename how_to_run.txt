#3. On Terminal type : 
    " python run.py"
#4. On bashing the above code on terminal , an local developement server starts and our webapp is active locally on localhost 5000
#5. We can directly use "ctrl + click" on the server link that will redirect you to the webapp on the default  browser.
    Or we can select the link and copy it and paste in any browser of your choice. 
#6.  Once the webapp is active, we can see the home page of the webapp. We can perform the desired actions on the webapp.
